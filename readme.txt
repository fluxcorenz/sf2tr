----------------------------

Manifesto:
Street Fighter 2 Turbo is a fantastic game. What if we create an arcade ROM hack ('remix') which removes randomness, rebalances the cast slightly, and alters palettes for a fresh new look at a 20 year old game?


Required SF2T ROM set is 921202 ETC (World):

filename       md5
----------     --------------------------------
sf2_22.bin     098fd247a83e521678533beddd6b742c
s92e_23a.bin   df2dfdd1685ed0badc48d7deb800d78e

Use the *.ips file to patch the relevant ROM. Any IPS patcher tool is fine, 
for example LunarIPS, available at: http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/

Zip up the roms into a sf2hf.zip and run with your favourite emulator that 
supports unverified roms (winkawaks for example).
